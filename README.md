## Known Issues

- "[Patch FR] Turtle WoW en francais + Pack de voix francaise corrige pour VoiceOver" is not supported. PallyPowerTW does not work correctly when this mod is installed.

## Notes

- Hunter pets and Warriors share the same class ID, so Greater Blessings affect both (not a bug).

## Changelog
- 09.04.26 - Add paladin selector to Assignment Grid top-left area. This way you can display specific paladin's individual blessings assignment (fix for feature request #25) 
- 01.03.26 - Event-driven scanning replaces timer-based polling (zero CPU cost when idle). TurtleWoW realm detection for correct blessing durations (also vanilla 1.12.1 compatible). New `/pp lock` slash command for toggling frame positions. Scan frequency repurposed as UI debounce interval (clamped to max 2s). Removed obsolete "Poll Per Frame" setting. Slash commands documented in README.
- 25.08.25 - If Salvation is assigned, user is tank, and no individual blessings, do not count against need (so the BuffBar button stays green even with tank missing Salvation).
- 25.08.25 - Assign/clear raid icon when player is marked as tank if we are Raid Leader/Assist or party leader.
- 22.08.25 - Allow assignments of seals for each paladin.
- 22.08.25 - Mark as tank reflects to pfUI tank assignment (if available). Don't allow GB on pets if Warriors assignment differs from pets assignment. If same assignment, mark both as GB-blessed.
- 09.08.25 - Warriors and hunter pets share same class so if they have same blessing assigned and you cast Greater Blessing, PP marks both Warriors and pets as blessed in BuffBar.
- 15.07.25 - Fix: When casting Greater Blessings and several targets are out of range, addon assumes they got the buff and does not allow re-cast of GB. Now those targets are correctly marked as needing blessing and allow re-cast of GB.
- 15.07.25 - Aura assignment is also saved in presets.
- 15.07.25 - Allow marking a player as a tank and sync with other paladins.
